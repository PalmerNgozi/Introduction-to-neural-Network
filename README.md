   Happy learning  I got everything from tensorflow wesite here : https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn 
A sentiment analysis notebook to check how potsitive or negative a movie review is.
This is a begginners guide.

I created a notebook that basically explains shy i did most of what i did. I will add it later. I am using the google colab. i will upload the notebook here also. 

Happy learning

Edits :
When i made a prediction i noticed it classified the negative a review with a nuber above 0.5 infact very postive. i am guessing the statement is not negative enough. but i am working on the model. I just wanted to save a copy of this first. you can also tell me how to improve the model. Thank You.
